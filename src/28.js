console.log('Genuary 28');

// No libraries, no canvas, only HTML elements.

// If you want to cheat and say that <canvas> or <svg> or even <img> are perfectly fine HTML elements, just remember that nobody ever hears the Genuary Police. I mean, has heard about the Genuary Police. It’s not true and there’s no such thing, stop asking. Anyhow, I don’t know have you heard about <div>’s? I heard they are pretty cool. Good luck!
